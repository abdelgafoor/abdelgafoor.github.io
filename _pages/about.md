👨🏻‍💻 I'm a final year PhD student at Khalifa University, UAE.

📚 I'm currently working on my Dissertation "Reinforcement Learning Generalization Through Homogeneity and Ensembles for Time-Variant UAV Systems".

🔬 My research interests are control systems, machine learning, and robotics. I like doing research that leads to technology that works and makes a high impact.

🤖 I believe that prosperity will be for those who empower robotics.
