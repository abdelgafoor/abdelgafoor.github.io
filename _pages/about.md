![test](/images/sad-robot.png){: .align-right width="300px"}
👨🏻‍💻I'm a final year PhD student at Khalifa University, UAE.

📚I'm currently working on my Dissertation "Reinforcement Learning Generalization Through Homogeneity and Ensembles for Time-Variant UAV Systems".

🔬My research interests are control systems, machine learning, and robotics. I love carrying out research that leads to superhuman performance and disruptive technologies.

🤖I believe that prosperity will be significantly boosted for nations that empower robotics. Although the robot in the image is lying (it might take your job), it will create better opportunities for everyone.
